This project is developed using a powerful technology stack that includes TypeScript, React, Next.js, tRPC, Prisma, MySQL and TailwindCSS, also known as the t3 stack. tRPC provides an end-to-end type safety feature which makes this one of my best web development experiences so far. I commenced this project as my final project for the Spiced academy bootcamp and I am excited to continue working on it as my primary side project.",

The project challenges the player to escape from a dungeon within a strict one-minute timeframe. As the game progresses, tension and adrenaline rise as the player must navigate through ever-narrower spaces. The project delivered a comprehensive development experience due to our team consisting of two programmers, an artist, a sound engineer, and a game designer.",

This project, developed as a crucial part of my thesis, uses Angular, TypeScript, Firebase, Sass and Three.js to bring the virtual game into a new visual dimension. Although the gameplay remains true to its traditional 2D nature, it offers an exciting twist upon clearing a line of bricks for players to enjoy. With an innovative approach, these bricks embrace dynamic physics and burst out of the scene, creating a unique amalgamation of traditional gameplay and dynamic 3D interactions. Blender was used to create all 3D elements for the game.",

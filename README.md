This repository contains the code for my Portfolio App, a web application that showcases my work, solutions, and skills as a developer.
To explore the live version of my portfolio, please click [here](https://flektor.vercel.app/)

## Technologies Used

This portfolio app is built using the following technologies:

- React
- Next.js
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS

## Hosting and Analytics

The app is hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) and utilizes Vercel Analytics for monitoring the user activity.

## Database

The messages are stored in a Postgres database hosted on Vercel. This allows me manage and retrieve user messages.

## CodeWars Katas Solutions

GitHub's API is used to fetch my Codewars solutions from my [repository](https://github.com/flektor/codewars-katas)

## Future Plans

In the future, I plan to implement the following features:

- Integration with a service like SendGrid to send actual emails. This will enhance communication and interaction with users and potential clients.

- Create pagination of my Codewars solutions, so that the user can select specific challenge. 

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the necessary dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Configure environment variables for the database, GitHub API, and any future integrations.
4. Run the app using `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`.
5. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.
